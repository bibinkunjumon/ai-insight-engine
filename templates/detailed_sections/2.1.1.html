                        <h5>Analysis</h5>
                        <p>
                            The inventory data from late January 2020 provides a snapshot of current stock levels
                            relative to optimal quantities for various products. A significant concern is evident across
                            multiple items, particularly the Gaming Mouse, Power Bank, and Scented Candles, which all
                            show declining stock levels below their optimal requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Starting with the <strong>Gaming Mouse</strong>, current stock levels have fallen from 64
                            units on January 28 to 55 units by January 31, while the optimal stock quantity remains at
                            78. This downward trend suggests a rapid turnover but also indicates a potential risk of
                            stockout if replenishment does not occur soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>Power Bank</strong> exhibits an alarming trend, with stock levels decreasing
                            from 24 units on January 17 to just 12 by January 23, falling short of the optimal level of
                            27. Such low inventory levels could lead to missed sales opportunities and dissatisfied
                            customers if demand continues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the <strong>Scented Candles</strong>, there is a notable decline in stock from 202
                            units on January 15 to only 17 units by January 23. The optimal quantity is 230, indicating
                            that sales have outpaced inventory significantly. This situation suggests that either the
                            product is highly popular, or initial stock levels were insufficient to meet customer
                            demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>Yoga Mat</strong> shows a gradual decrease from 82 units on January 6 to just 11
                            units by January 19. This trend indicates that while sales are steady, the stock level is
                            insufficient compared to the optimal quantity of 86, which could lead to stockouts if demand
                            continues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>Hydro Bottle</strong> is currently at 20 units, significantly below its optimal
                            stock level of 229. This dramatic decline highlights a critical need for replenishment to
                            avoid a complete stockout, as current stock levels have decreased from 220 units on January
                            14.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Running Shoes</strong> and <strong>Cotton Sheets</strong> also reflect decreasing
                            trends. The Running Shoes drop from 65 to 12 units, while Cotton Sheets decline from 74 to
                            11 units. Both products are nearing critical low levels compared to their optimal
                            quantities, indicating that immediate action is required to replenish these stocks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In summary, the data indicates a significant mismatch between current stock levels and
                            optimal quantities across several products, raising concerns about potential stockouts and
                            lost sales. Recommendations for inventory management include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Immediate Stock Replenishment:</strong> Prioritize ordering for high-demand
                                items such as Scented Candles, Power Banks, and Hydro Bottles to restore optimal stock
                                levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review Sales Trends:</strong> Analyze sales data to better forecast demand for
                                each product and adjust stock levels accordingly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement Inventory Alerts:</strong> Set alerts for low stock levels to trigger
                                automatic reordering when inventory falls below a certain threshold.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate Optimal Stock Levels:</strong> Regularly reassess optimal stock
                                quantities based on current market trends and historical sales data to ensure alignment
                                with demand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider Safety Stock:</strong> Maintain a safety stock buffer for high-demand
                                products to mitigate risks of stockouts during peak sales periods.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By taking these actions, the company can enhance its inventory management processes,
                            ensuring that stock levels align more closely with consumer demand and optimizing sales
                            potential.
