                        <h5>Analysis</h5>
                        <p><strong>Popular Products:</strong> Products like "Comfort Pillow," "Yoga Mat," and "Face
                            Serum" consistently appear in search and purchase patterns. "Comfort Pillow" has high
                            purchase counts across customers, while "Yoga Mat" and "Face Serum" show popularity in both
                            searches and purchases.</p>

                        <p><strong>High Purchase-to-Search Ratios:</strong> "Comfort Pillow" and "Cotton Sheets"
                            demonstrate relatively high conversion rates for certain customers, such as Customer ID
                            C1001, who made 30 purchases out of 32 searches for "Comfort Pillow." This trend suggests
                            these products are highly desirable once searched.</p>

                        <p><strong>Low Purchase-to-Search Ratios:</strong> Products like "Power Bank" and "Scented
                            Candles" exhibit a low purchase-to-search ratio among several customers. For instance,
                            Customer ID C1005 searched for "Power Bank" 36 times but made only 1 purchase. These
                            products may need more targeted promotions or improved recommendations to boost purchases.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Frequent Recommendations:</strong> Recommended products for high-demand items such as
                            "Face Serum" and "Gaming Mouse" include related items like "Power Bank" and "Yoga Mat,"
                            suggesting bundling potential. However, it's notable that recommended products are not
                            always aligned with the actual high-purchase products, suggesting room for optimization in
                            recommendation algorithms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Low-Interest Products:</strong> "Running Shoes" has notably low engagement, with many
                            customers showing zero purchases despite some searches. This pattern highlights "Running
                            Shoes" as a product with either low visibility or interest, indicating it may need
                            reassessment in terms of placement, promotion, or even inclusion.</p>

                        <p><strong>Purchase Patterns by Customer:</strong> Certain customers show distinct purchasing
                            patterns. For instance, Customer ID C1003 favors "Yoga Mat" with 33 purchases and has low
                            interest in "Power Bank" and "Gaming Mouse." Tailoring marketing and offers for these
                            customers based on their preferences could increase engagement.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cross-Selling Opportunities:</strong> For products like "Face Serum" and "Wireless
                            Earbuds," which are often paired as recommendations, encouraging cross-sells in the buying
                            journey could increase sales. Additionally, high-value items like "Gaming Mouse" paired with
                            fitness products like "Yoga Mat" hint at possible cross-category appeal.</p>

                        <p><strong>Customer-Specific Insights:</strong> Customers such as C1002 and C1004 demonstrate
                            more balanced shopping behaviors with moderate search and purchase numbers across a variety
                            of products. Personalized marketing that leverages this balance by recommending new products
                            might engage these customers further.</p>

                        <p><strong>High Engagement Products:</strong> "Yoga Mat," "Comfort Pillow," and "Face Serum" are
                            among the products with both high search and purchase numbers across customers, indicating
                            high engagement. Highlighting these items in campaigns may lead to better sales performance.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Recommendations for Improvement:</strong> To boost conversion rates for
                            lower-performing products, targeted offers, adjusted recommendations, and strategic
                            visibility improvements should be considered. For instance, "Running Shoes" might benefit
                            from improved recommendations or bundling with more popular fitness-related items.</p>
